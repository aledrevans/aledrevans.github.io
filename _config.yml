title_description: "I've been on lockdown in the UK for several weeks now because of coronavirus. During that time, I've been eating an excessive amount of cheesecake, mostly from Tesco, and I've decided to rate each cheesecake I eat on this blog, because I'm bored. Enjoy my nonsensical ratings of cheesecake quality."
